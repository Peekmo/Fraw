Webassembly front framework (prototype/test)

This is my experiments with Webassembly and Rust (I'm not a Rust developer).
It's a little "component" framework based on the amazing [Koute's stdweb lib](https://github.com/koute/stdweb).

If you're looking for a probably more active, more functional webassembly framework, in the spirit of Elm feel free to take a look at [yew](https://github.com/DenisKolodin/yew).
